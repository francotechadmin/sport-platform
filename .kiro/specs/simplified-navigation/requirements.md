# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature simplifies the application's navigation structure by making the chat functionality the primary interface instead of the dashboard, while providing visual indicators for undeveloped sections. The change reflects the current development focus on chat functionality and improves user experience by directing users to the most developed features first.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want chat to be the default landing page after authentication, so that I can immediately access the most developed functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user first logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the chat page instead of the dashboard
2. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to the root dashboard route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the chat page
3. WHEN a user accesses the chat page THEN the system SHALL display the full chat interface with all current functionality
4. WHEN the chat page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing chat features and performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily navigate between available sections, so that I can access analytics and chat features seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL display navigation links for "Chat" and "Analytics" as primary options
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Chat" navigation link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the chat page
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Analytics" navigation link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the analytics page
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL highlight the current active section in the navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which sections are under development, so that I understand what functionality is not yet available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the navigation THEN the system SHALL display "Locker Room" and "Performance" sections with visual indicators showing they are under development
2. WHEN undeveloped sections are displayed THEN the system SHALL use grayed-out styling to indicate unavailability
3. WHEN a user hovers over undeveloped sections THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip indicating "Coming Soon" or similar message
4. WHEN a user clicks on undeveloped sections THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and optionally show a message about future availability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to be consistent across all pages, so that I can always access available features regardless of my current location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the chat page THEN the system SHALL display the same navigation structure as other pages
2. WHEN a user is on the analytics page THEN the system SHALL display the same navigation structure as other pages
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation positioning and styling
4. WHEN the navigation renders THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design works across different screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual hierarchy in the navigation, so that I can quickly identify primary features versus those under development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navigation renders THEN the system SHALL display "Chat" and "Analytics" with full color and normal styling
2. WHEN the navigation renders THEN the system SHALL display "Locker Room" and "Performance" with reduced opacity or grayed-out appearance
3. WHEN displaying navigation items THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing and typography for all items
4. WHEN showing development status THEN the system SHALL use subtle visual cues that don't clutter the interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the URL structure to reflect the new navigation priority, so that bookmarks and direct links work intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user bookmarks the chat page THEN the system SHALL use a clean, intuitive URL structure
2. WHEN a user shares a direct link to chat THEN the system SHALL ensure the link works correctly for other authenticated users
3. WHEN URL routing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper browser history for back/forward navigation
4. WHEN a user accesses old dashboard URLs THEN the system SHALL redirect appropriately to maintain backward compatibility
