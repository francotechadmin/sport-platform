# Design Document

## Overview

The landing page will serve as the primary entry point for new visitors to ProFormAi, replacing the current automatic redirect behavior in the root page. The design will create a compelling first impression that communicates the value of AI-driven personalized coaching while maintaining consistency with the existing design system.

The landing page will be implemented as a modern, responsive React component using Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, following the established patterns in the codebase. It will integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication system and theme provider.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
LandingPage (src/app/page.tsx)
├── HeroSection
│   ├── Navigation Header
│   ├── Hero Content
│   └── Primary CTA
├── FeaturesSection
│   ├── Feature Cards (3-4 features)
│   └── Visual Elements
├── SocialProofSection (optional)
│   └── Testimonials/Stats
└── FooterCTA
    ├── Secondary CTA
    └── Sign In Link
```

### Routing Integration
- Modify `src/app/page.tsx` to conditionally render the landing page for unauthenticated users
- Maintain existing redirect logic for authenticated users to `/chat`
- Preserve loading states during authentication checks

### Theme Integration
- Leverage existing ThemeProvider for dark/light mode support
- Use established CSS custom properties and Tailwind configuration
- Maintain consistent styling with existing UI components

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### LandingPage Component
```typescript
interface LandingPageProps {
  // No props needed - uses auth context internally
}

const LandingPage: React.FC<LandingPageProps> = () => {
  // Component implementation
}
```

#### HeroSection Component
```typescript
interface HeroSectionProps {
  onGetStarted: () => void;
  onSignIn: () => void;
}
```

#### FeatureCard Component
```typescript
interface FeatureCardProps {
  icon: React.ReactNode;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  highlight?: boolean;
}
```

#### Navigation Component
```typescript
interface NavigationProps {
  onSignIn: () => void;
  onGetStarted: () => void;
}
```

### Reusable UI Components
- Utilize existing `Button` component with variants (default, outline, ghost)
- Leverage `Card` components for feature sections
- Use established typography and spacing patterns
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints

## Data Models

### Feature Data Structure
```typescript
interface Feature {
  id: string;
  icon: string; // Lucide icon name
  title: string;
  description: string;
  highlight?: boolean;
}

const features: Feature[] = [
  {
    id: 'personalized-coaching',
    icon: 'User',
    title: 'Personalized AI Coaching',
    description: 'Get tailored guidance based on your unique goals and progress'
  },
  // Additional features...
];
```

### Content Configuration
```typescript
interface LandingPageContent {
  hero: {
    headline: string;
    subheadline: string;
    ctaPrimary: string;
    ctaSecondary: string;
  };
  features: Feature[];
  footer: {
    ctaText: string;
    signInText: string;
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Authentication State Management
- Handle loading states gracefully with existing Spinner component
- Manage authentication errors through existing AuthContext
- Provide fallback content if authentication check fails

### Navigation Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries for routing failures
- Handle network errors during sign-in/sign-up redirects
- Provide user feedback through existing toast system (Sonner)

### Performance Error Handling
- Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical content
- Handle slow network conditions with progressive loading
- Provide skeleton states for loading content

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components (HeroSection, FeatureCard, Navigation)
- Mock authentication context for different user states
- Test responsive behavior and theme switching
- Validate accessibility features and keyboard navigation

### Integration Testing
- Test authentication flow integration
- Verify routing behavior for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- Test theme provider integration
- Validate form submissions and error handling

### Visual Testing
- Test responsive design across breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify dark/light theme consistency
- Test component rendering with different content lengths
- Validate loading states and transitions

### Performance Testing
- Measure page load times and Core Web Vitals
- Test image optimization and lazy loading
- Validate bundle size impact
- Test performance on slower devices/networks

## Implementation Details

### Responsive Design Strategy
- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind breakpoints
- Flexible grid layouts for feature sections
- Optimized typography scaling across devices
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

### SEO and Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
