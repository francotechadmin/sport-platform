# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the existing web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) to provide users with a native app-like experience. The PWA implementation will enable offline functionality, app installation, push notifications, and improved performance through service workers and caching strategies. This will enhance user engagement and accessibility across different devices and network conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the app on my device like a native app, so that I can access it quickly from my home screen without opening a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the app on a supported browser THEN the system SHALL display an install prompt
2. WHEN a user installs the app THEN the system SHALL create a home screen icon with the app branding
3. WHEN a user opens the installed app THEN the system SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. IF the user is on iOS Safari THEN the system SHALL provide manual installation instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline or with poor network connectivity, so that I can continue using core features even when my internet connection is unreliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loses internet connection THEN the system SHALL continue to display previously cached content
2. WHEN a user tries to access cached pages offline THEN the system SHALL serve them from local storage
3. WHEN a user performs actions offline THEN the system SHALL queue them for sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL display appropriate offline indicators and messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive push notifications about important updates and messages, so that I stay engaged with the app even when not actively using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user grants notification permission THEN the system SHALL be able to send push notifications
2. WHEN important events occur THEN the system SHALL send relevant push notifications to subscribed users
3. WHEN a user clicks a notification THEN the system SHALL open the app to the relevant content
4. WHEN a user wants to manage notifications THEN the system SHALL provide settings to control notification preferences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to load quickly and perform well, so that I have a smooth experience comparable to native apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the app THEN the system SHALL load the initial content within 2 seconds on 3G networks
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL provide instant transitions through caching
3. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical resources and defer non-essential content
4. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL restore their previous state and position

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different devices and platforms, I want the app to work consistently across mobile, tablet, and desktop, so that I have a unified experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the app on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-optimized interactions
2. WHEN a user accesses the app on desktop THEN the system SHALL adapt to larger screens and mouse/keyboard input
3. WHEN a user switches between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality and appearance
4. WHEN the app is installed THEN the system SHALL respect platform-specific design conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the install prompt to be unobtrusive and well-timed, so that it doesn't interfere with my initial app experience or feel spammy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on mobile THEN the install prompt SHALL be compact and positioned to avoid overlapping critical UI elements
2. WHEN other modals or onboarding flows are active THEN the install prompt SHALL be delayed or hidden to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN a user dismisses the install prompt THEN the system SHALL respect the dismissal and not show it again for a reasonable period
4. WHEN the install prompt appears THEN it SHALL use subtle animations and non-intrusive styling appropriate for mobile devices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PWA implementation to be maintainable and follow best practices, so that the app remains reliable and can be easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is deployed THEN the system SHALL automatically update the service worker and cache strategies
2. WHEN new versions are available THEN the system SHALL prompt users to update or update automatically
3. WHEN errors occur in the service worker THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and fallback gracefully
4. WHEN the app is audited THEN the system SHALL meet PWA criteria and achieve high Lighthouse scores
