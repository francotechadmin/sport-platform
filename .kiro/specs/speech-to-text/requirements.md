# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements speech-to-text functionality using the browser's built-in Web Speech API, allowing users to input messages via voice in the chat interface. The implementation will provide a seamless voice input experience while maintaining compatibility with existing text input methods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use voice input to send messages in the chat, so that I can communicate more naturally and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the chat page THEN the system SHALL display a microphone button or voice input control
2. WHEN a user clicks the microphone button THEN the system SHALL start listening for speech input using the browser's Web Speech API
3. WHEN speech is detected THEN the system SHALL convert the speech to text in real-time
4. WHEN speech-to-text conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL populate the chat input field with the converted text
5. WHEN the user stops speaking THEN the system SHALL automatically stop listening after a reasonable timeout period

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during voice input, so that I understand when the system is listening and processing my speech.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is active THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing that it's listening (e.g., animated microphone icon, pulsing effect)
2. WHEN speech is being processed THEN the system SHALL show a processing indicator
3. WHEN voice input is complete THEN the system SHALL return to the normal input state
4. WHEN an error occurs during voice input THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control voice input manually, so that I can start and stop recording when convenient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the microphone button while not recording THEN the system SHALL start voice input
2. WHEN a user clicks the microphone button while recording THEN the system SHALL stop voice input
3. WHEN voice input is active THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to cancel or stop the recording
4. WHEN voice input is stopped manually THEN the system SHALL process any captured speech and populate the input field

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice input to work seamlessly with existing chat functionality, so that I can use both text and voice input interchangeably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input populates the text field THEN the system SHALL allow further text editing before sending
2. WHEN voice input is added to existing text THEN the system SHALL append or insert the speech text appropriately
3. WHEN the send button is clicked after voice input THEN the system SHALL send the message using the existing chat functionality
4. WHEN voice input is used THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing chat features (message history, formatting, etc.)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice input to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when speech recognition fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser doesn't support speech recognition THEN the system SHALL hide the voice input option or show an appropriate message
2. WHEN microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL display a clear message explaining how to enable microphone permissions
3. WHEN speech recognition fails or times out THEN the system SHALL show an error message and allow the user to try again
4. WHEN no speech is detected THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and return to the normal input state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice input to respect my privacy and security, so that my voice data is handled appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is used THEN the system SHALL only use the browser's built-in speech recognition (no external services)
2. WHEN speech recognition occurs THEN the system SHALL not store or transmit raw audio data
3. WHEN voice input is processed THEN the system SHALL only work with the resulting text, not audio recordings
4. WHEN the user stops using voice input THEN the system SHALL immediately stop accessing the microphone
