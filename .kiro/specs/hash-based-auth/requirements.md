# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a client-side hash-based authentication system that provides secure user registration and login functionality without requiring a backend authentication service. The system will use browser-based password hashing and local storage to manage user credentials and session state, replacing the current non-functional authentication flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password, so that I can access the sports platform dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the sign-up page THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with email, password, and confirm password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL hash the password using a secure client-side hashing algorithm
3. WHEN password hashing is complete THEN the system SHALL store the email and hashed password in browser local storage
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. IF the email already exists in local storage THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Email already registered"
6. IF password and confirm password don't match THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Passwords do not match"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my personalized dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits login credentials THEN the system SHALL hash the entered password using the same algorithm used during registration
3. WHEN password hashing is complete THEN the system SHALL compare the hashed password with the stored hash for that email
4. IF credentials match THEN the system SHALL create a session token and redirect to the dashboard
5. IF credentials don't match THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Invalid email or password"
6. IF the email doesn't exist in local storage THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Invalid email or password"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to persist across browser tabs and page refreshes, so that I don't have to repeatedly sign in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store a session token in browser local storage
2. WHEN a user navigates to protected pages THEN the system SHALL verify the session token exists and is valid
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page or opens a new tab THEN the system SHALL maintain the authenticated state if a valid session exists
4. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain the authenticated state if a valid session exists

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to sign out of my account, so that I can protect my privacy when using shared devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the sign-out button THEN the system SHALL remove the session token from local storage
2. WHEN sign-out is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the sign-in page
3. WHEN a user is signed out THEN the system SHALL prevent access to protected dashboard pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically redirected based on my authentication state, so that I have a seamless experience navigating the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected pages THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the sign-in page
2. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to sign-in or sign-up pages THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user's session expires or becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the sign-in page

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my password to be securely handled, so that my account remains protected even with client-side storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL use a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm (bcrypt or similar)
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL never store plain text passwords
3. WHEN comparing passwords THEN the system SHALL only compare hashed values
4. WHEN generating session tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random values
